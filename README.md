# UniBot
A small chatbot for a first year or fresher at university.
UniBot can answer most standard questions a new first year student may have.

UniBot calls on the SurreyUni.py file for information relating to the university.
 Any university can be added to allow UniBot to describe any University, simply change the import to a different file, with the relevant information.
